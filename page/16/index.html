lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><font size="3"><span style="font-family:宋体;">我是个书痴，在闲闲书话呆了不短时间，一直手痒痒想写篇系统地介绍各种书的文章。英国维多利亚时期有个知名的自由派政治家，叫格拉史东（</span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">William Evwrt Gladstone 1809</font></span><span style="font-family:宋体;">－</span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">1898</font></span><span style="font-family:宋体;">），该人不仅当了四届首相，而且据说一生读了两万多本书。我连他读的书四分一都没达到，想想还是别献丑了。再说了，闲闲书话人才济济，我还是搬个板凳听听课最好，顶多偶尔扯扯淡，看到不平事扔块砖，见到大师恭敬地鞠个躬。</span></font><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><span style="font-family:宋体;"><font size="3">现在我要开始扯淡了。</font></span><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><span style="font-family:宋体;"><font size="3">看了无数文章，总觉得最好看的文章是文理兼通的人写的，可惜这样的人在中国少得可怜，这跟中国的教育制度有关。书话有个帖子叫“喜欢《红楼梦》和《百年孤独》的人是幸福的”，有个回帖是这样的“如果我两本都讨厌，就是不幸福？……先学会点逻辑再说话，楼主。”不懂逻辑却用其攻击别人，无知且狂妄，这应该是个极端的文科生。一般的文科生写的文章，语言华丽，言之无物。和文科生相反，理科生的思维能力相对较强，可语言能力普遍极弱，写篇一千字的文章都叫苦连天。假若打破了文理之间的界限，世界是如此宽广……</font></span><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><font size="3"><span style="font-family:宋体;">冯友兰</span><span style="font-family:宋体;">先生在《中国哲学简史》中说：“历稽载籍，良史必有三长：才，学，识。</span><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><span style="font-family:宋体;">学者，史料精熟也；识者，选材精当也；才者，文笔精妙也。”我把冯先生对才学识的定义稍稍修改一下，学指知识，识指见识，才指文笔。学，不难达到，不断看书就行；才，也不难，多看书或文章并且多模仿大师以及坚持写作就行；识，极难获得，需要系统的思维训练。有学者极多，有才者少，有识者较少，才识兼备者极少，才学识兼备者更是难得一见。我比较不知天高地厚，才、学、识再加上德，是我力求达到的境界。子曰：“吾未见有好德如好色者也。”如果用好色来衡量好德的程度，我敢夸下海口，本人的道德水准已经达到了相当高的水平。</span></font><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><span style="font-family:宋体;"><font size="3">如果仅仅用才和学作为牛人的标准，闲闲书话的整体水平是极高的。可惜一旦加上一个“识”，马上下降不少。无论社会科学，还是自然科学，教科书每章的后面都会有习题。为什么？这正是培养“识”的主要途径。很多人欣赏德里达，喜欢对文本作天马行空的解读，殊不知，正是这种习惯扼杀了“识”的获得。任何学科都有框架，政治学、经济学、历史学、管理学、哲学、文学、数学等等等等。不是说读了几本哈维尔的著作，就理解了民主；不是说读了《国富论》，就入了经济学的门；不是说读完了二十四史，就自动获得了高明的历史观……我总看见很多学文的人，对涉及政治、经济、历史等的问题引经据典长篇大论，可分析的过程及结论一塌糊涂。分析的问题不同，用到的分析框架也不同，就如使用瑞士军刀，需要变换各种工具。很可惜，很多人手上的“瑞士军刀”是有缺陷的，不是工具太少，就是工具不好使，因此总不能很好地解决各种问题。我说过一句话“获得思想的思想之前，读一本书和一千本书没有任何的区别”。磨刀不误砍柴工，我觉得读书不应该光追求数量，而应该先学会读书（例如看看莫提默和查尔斯的《如何阅读一本书》）。现代人太浮躁，不要说拥有一把精美的“瑞士军刀”，哪怕只拥有一样得心应手的工具已经是幸事。</font></span><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><span style="font-family:宋体;"><font size="3">说着说着，我又开始出冷汗了，以上所说从某种程度上来说是我的反思。除了计算机科学，在其它某几个领域，我的水平可能接近本科生的水平，我太贪心。长此以往，可能我会变成觉得自己的研究泛而不精的梁启超。不过能够变成粱先生也不错，毕竟是大牛。今天我爸才郑重警告我，以后要把自己的业余爱好放一放，不要荒废了自己的计算机专业，可能他发现了我刚买的《阅读大师》和《书趣》。可我固执地认为，正是我的这些业余爱好，让我成为一头“紫牛”（《紫牛》）。</font></span><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><font size="3"><span style="font-family:宋体;">曾经天真地认为自己是个大牛，因为我发现自己有很多的</span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">fans</font></span><span style="font-family:宋体;">，他们把能够找到的我写的只言片语都读一遍甚至几遍，还给我写长长的信。不过后来发现他们大部分都是高中生和大学生，于是清醒起来。王怡先生曾在国外某会议上发言，里面提到他选择放弃了启蒙，不管理由是什么，他在我眼里都是懦夫。在现在的中国，只有顶住压力，默默地启蒙新一代的人最值得尊敬。关天是我很喜爱的版块，仅次于开心乐园。看着里面的精英清谈与争吵，真的很开心。其实我很怀疑，里面有否三个人知道什么是民主（也包括我），很多精英连网络上的</span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">ID</font></span><span style="font-family:宋体;">都不一视同仁，还谈民主，好笑吧？民主不仅仅是一种制度，更是一种理念。像香港人，不管大陆采取何种制度，民主之光始终闪耀，因为民主这种理念已经深入民心，制度总会向民主方向靠拢。人永远是一切的原动力，无论改变任何事物，从改变人的思想开始。像王怡那样的宪政专家，如果能够放下“精英”的架子，坚持不懈地向大众传播自己的理念，星星之火，终会燎原，可惜了。我是坚持走启蒙这条路的，无论任何方面，只要我懂的，我就帮助别人提高。这也是为什么我愿意写一些别人看上去很傻的文章，以及花无数个小时给一个个根本不认识的人回信的原因。从某种程度上来说，我是个洗脑者，但我替人洗脑的宗旨永远只有一条：拥有自己的思想，成为一个真正的人。星星之火，可以燎原。</span></font><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></span><br><br><font size="3"><span style="font-family:宋体;">在闲闲书话，我说话不多，因为我有自知之明，懂得藏拙。人笨，话一多就露馅了。书话还是很好的，精英很多。不过女性斑竹有点拽，除了夏</span><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman">MM</font></span><span style="font-family:宋体;">。不过也怪不得人家，可能是因为我发消息的时候在最后加了句“你是不是美女？”吧。</span></font><br><br><span lang="EN-US"><font face="Times New Roman"

            <p>左兄，若不嫌弃，我再罗嗦几句。</p>
<p>每个人都有发表意见的权利，我只是觉得因为别人的某种想法就推断他（她）“不会生活”，有点不妥，无论他（她）的想法是什么。生活的内涵太丰富了，而书只是其中很小的一部分（当然，不排除在某些人的生活里书占很重要的地位）。“不会生活”这顶帽子实在太大，我不同意。可哪怕你说，因为味道差不多而拒绝阅读，是不会读书的表现，我还是不同意。对不同的人，乐趣的来源不同，为什么“味道不同”不可以成为读书乐趣的来源呢？再说了，味道是很私人化的东西，别人的味道和自己的味道是两回事，这很重要。因此，你在某人的书籍里面挖掘到的不同乐趣，在别人眼里却成了“相同味道”，那很正常。</p>
<p>我认为，要么不要较真，要么认认真真。不较真的情况是，尊重别人的看法并坦然接受。认真的情况是，想方设法弄明白说“相同味道”的人的真实水平，再给出自己的判断。说同样的话的人，水平可能大相径庭。孤立地评价某句话或者某种观点，很难客观，因为背后往往隐藏着一个巨大的支撑系统。那个系统有多庞大，你忽略了。就如漂在海面的两座冰山，光看水面的部分，不难判断哪座冰山大，可包括水底看不到的部分，哪座更大？光看水面的部分是（一两句话）是看不出的，只有碰撞（深入的多回合交流）才有答案。假如有人说闲闲书话的女斑竹水平很菜，他（她）可能是大牛人，也可能是无知小儿，：）</p>
<p>小的时候，很喜欢看辩论比赛。长大了，发现辩论比赛其实没什么意义，只会越辩越糊涂。辩论要在大家有相同的出发点的情况下，才有意义。甲对某个名词有自己的定义，乙对同一个名词有另外的理解，你一言，我一语，其实大家都是自说自话，干脆给每人几分钟演讲得了。如果说“味道相同，不读”的人，是个根本不喜欢看书的人，你说他（她）“不会生活”，我认为很冤枉；如果他（她）是个喜欢书的人，只是对书的鉴赏力方面尚有待提高，你说他（她）不会生活，我认为非常冤枉；如果他（她）是个阅书无数，看书的境界已趋化境，一般的书难以入法眼的超级鉴赏家，你那样说他（她），我认为是相当的冤枉。可能他（她）只喜欢卡尔维诺那种不断推陈出新的天才作家的作品，可能他（她）看过比张中行写得好得多的作品，可能他（她）根本不看散文只是随口那么一说……我也有点较真了，打住。</p>
<p>归根到底，我觉得可能是你太喜欢张中行先生，在他的作品中得到过太多的乐趣，所以难以忍受“张中行的文章多看几篇，味道都差不多”这种说法吧。其实在我看来，无论“张中行”三个字换成任何一个名字，这种说法都是可以接受的。“味道”在这里可以理解为“风格”。总的来说，我和ernie兄的很多看法高度一致。差点忘了，先和ernie兄握握手。</p>
<p>说来说去，阅读是很主观的行为，而各人抱着不同的目的，很难对不同的问题一概而论。就我个人而言，认为某某作家的作品不可不读，难以成大器。就散文而言，每个人心目中都有个排名，周作人的散文未必排第一，可能排十七。即使天下公认他的散文第一，只读公认排第二的行不行？更不要说根本无法排出公认的排名了。我好几次想静下心来看看他的散文，一直看不进去，除了那篇短短的聊“初恋”的。沈从文先生的散文，天下都说好，可我不喜欢那种风格，于是也不看。而阿城和史铁生的散文，我是喜欢的，可不读他们问题也不大。要说真有不可不读的散文家，首推庄周，千古只此一人。曾经写过一段话：“想写好散文，坚持读经典书籍，坚持思考，坚持用心观察世界，坚持写作即可，没有任何一个人的书是不可不读的。坚持读好书，旁征博引，信手拈来；古人云“学而不思则罔”， 坚持思考，思维能力会不断提高，反映在文中即逻辑井然；坚持用心观察世界，看问题会直抵本质，境界自然浮起来；所谓工多艺熟，和文字打交道多了，即使随手码字也像模像样，至于整体质量如何，那是另一回事。简单言之，若坚持在文、理、情、工几方面下功夫，自成一派，指日可待。做事的最高境界，是进入一种忘我的状态，不记得任何规则，但无论怎样做，都在规则之内。若总是想着周作人、董桥、汪曾祺、阿城、孙犁等人，出师之日远矣。当然，推荐某人的作品可以，但若说不可不读某人的作品，我不敢苟同。作为一个远未出师之人，以上所说只是抛砖引玉之言，望见谅。”从成为一个散文家的角度而言，阅读只是手段而已，并不是目的，而路永远不止一条。</p>
<p>再次抛砖引玉，有点长，望大家见谅，：）</p>

            <div id="msgcns!5156F7D537FE522!198" class="bvMsg"><div>你想表达的东西很多，我想，这在很大程度上表现了你对孩子的殷殷期望。首先，我简单说一下我对本文某些措辞的意见。</div><br><div> </div><br><div>“而我则开始走人生的下坡路了”－－才三十三岁就开始走人生的下坡路了？抱这样心态的人，不可能是强者。尤其是你在后文还对“强者”与“弱者”进行了论述，这句话让后面的论述变得软弱无力。没有一个聪明人会重视一个弱者给出的自强意见。</div><br><div> </div><br><div>“作为一个女人，尽管你的容貌很平常，所幸的是你不丑，更重要的是你聪明，我想，幸福之门并非为你关闭着的。”－－一个父亲，永远不应该告诉自己的孩子，他（她）的容貌很平常，最起码我永远也不会这样做。假如你想让孩子清楚地认识自己，尽管他（她）真的不漂亮，你绝对不应采用这样的方式。采用何种方式没有定律，但达到的效果应该是这样的：你的孩子会想，也许我不漂亮，但在我爸爸眼里，我是最漂亮的。　</div><br><div> </div><br><div>“幸福之门也会为你洞开的。对此，我还有一点信心。”－－为什么你不告诉你的女儿：“我对你充满信心！”？</div><br><div> </div><br><div><br>“人生是险恶的。”－－她才三岁，你就想着告诉她人生是险恶的？不要说十三岁，即使她已经十八岁，你也要花点心思，想想如何才能让她顺利地过渡到险恶的社会中去。这个过程也没有公式，但起到的效果应该是这样的：你的孩子明白，这个世界并不是那么美好，但也不那么糟糕。如果你能耐再大一点，你的孩子如果再幸运一点，她会成为这样的人：她很清楚这个世界不是完美的，但她深深热爱着这个世界。</div><br><div> </div><br><div><br>以上是我粗略看一遍挑出来的几点“毛病”。其次，我想说说自己看到本文之后所产生的一些想法。</div><br><div> </div><br><div>大部分父母都是爱子女的，这点不容置疑，但不是所有父母都很好地承担了教育子女的义务。像本文这类文章，反映了中国绝大部分家长想向子女灌输的一种心态：我这辈子已经没有盼头了，我把所有的期望都寄托在你身上了，你要争气，不要让父母失望。这种心态，给子女带来的更多是压力和迷惘。言教不如身教，请从自身做起，给子女树立一个好榜样。光说有什么用？教育是一个长期及艰巨的过程，不要妄想一蹴而就。常常看到一些夸大其词的书或文章的标题，例如“改变你人生的*句话”等等，我都哑然失笑。人生岂是几句话能够改变的？即使几句话真的改变了一个人的一生，那几句话也仅仅是一条导火索，背后肯定有一连串的连环综合反应。如果父母对孩子的一番见解深刻的话，能够引发连环反应过程，那固然是好事。只可惜，事情远没那么简单。深刻的见解并不容易见到，即使见到，要深刻理解并将其融入自己的血液中，这也很难。因此，我并不赞成父母写这样的文章给子女，因为几乎没有任何效果。不要说短短的一篇文章，哪怕是写成《颜氏家训》、《曾国藩家书》诸如此类的书籍，作用也不大。</div><br><div> </div><br><div>教育的关键在哪里呢？我在前面已经说了，言教不如身教，身教就是教育的关键。如果父母整天扔垃圾，不要指望孩子爱清洁；如果父母处理不好婚姻关系，不要指望孩子相信婚姻；如果父母满口粗言秽语，不要指望孩子彬彬有礼；如果父母厌恶书本，不要指望孩子热爱学习…… 如果不是马上就要离开这个世界，没有必要写什么文章教育子女，做好自己就可以了。父母给孩子打造了一个天堂，孩子自然会成为天使，这是水到渠成的。</div></div>

            <div id="msgcns!5156F7D537FE522!142" class="bvMsg"><div>　　对于注注的问题<br><br>　　1，生日帖飘红是否合适，该不该取消？<br>　　2，斑竹是否应该动用权力影响网友的信息选择权？<br>　　3，网络论坛是否该是个人人完全平等的地方？<br>　　4，斑竹是否应该对论坛上每一个ID都一视同仁，同等对待？<br><br>　　我的回答如下：<br><br>　　1、看具体情况（如果某项传统是一个很有人情味的论坛的特色，我不反对这种传统。假如一个不出名的网友生了儿子或者结婚什么的，版主也给这个朋友飘红，我也会加入祝福的行列。）<br><br>　　2、看具体情况（版主有能力影响网友的信息选择权，但不应该滥用这种权力。版主可以给帖子红脸、黑脸、飘红、删贴等等，这些都是影响网友信息选择权的手段。这种权力很容易被滥用，一个成熟的社区应有保证这种权力不被滥用的制度，而且明确规定这种权力覆盖的范围。也许争端在于版主给一个生日贴飘红有没有滥用自己的权力。如果把这个生日贴和其它文章等同起来，版主觉得好就可以飘红甚至给红脸，那么版主并没有滥用他的权力，哪怕他的确存在私心。但是这样等同起来是不合适的，试想如果版主自己发了个腐败贴（虽然多数版主不会这样做），然后飘红，这件事跟给生日贴飘红的性质是一样的，他完全可以为自己辩护说没有滥用自己的权力，但这样影响网友的信息选择权对么？只有完善的制度，而不是领导者的自觉性，才能保证一个社区的健康发展。为什么？看看历史就知道。生活在帝制时代，遇到一个好皇帝，百姓丰衣足食；出了一个昏君，百姓生灵涂炭。有个好版主，哪怕制度不完善，隐藏的问题大家看不到；一旦来了个不怎么样的版主，大家恐怕就要叫苦连天甚至拍拍屁股走人了。在我看来，版主影响网友的信息选择权时需要标准，例如给红脸，是因为文章符合闲闲书话的宗旨；给黑脸，是因为精彩却让人哭笑不得；飘红是因为社区呼吁大家关注这件事；删贴是因为帖子内容不符合闲闲书话的宗旨。所以版主给生日贴飘红的时候是代表社区去给一个人生日祝福的。代表社区的时候，就应该慎重了。注注说这是传统，想必以前整个广场上只有一个小帐篷，所以在广场上为小帐篷的活动助庆跟坐在小帐篷里面助庆看上去没什么区别。但是广场上扎帐篷的人多了，这种风俗就过时了。可惜很多人还没有跟上社区发展的步伐，还停留在以前的那个时代，看不到广场上的其它人。就像散人，把小圈子理解为所有来闲闲书话的人，他说这句话的时候，是坐在自己的小帐篷里说的，看到的并不是整个广场。<br><br>　　3、是（世界是怎样的，跟世界应该是怎样的是两个概念。哪怕这个世界不存在绝对的平等，但我们应该把追求人人平等作为一个为之奋斗的目标。湖人你真的生活在美国吗？我觉得你人在美国，身上似乎完全没有吸收到半点美国的思想精髓。如果在网络上不应该人人平等，这种等级该按照什么来划分呢？财富？地位？资格？你还申请当版主，你怎么可能做个公正的版主呢？不可能的。在现实中，美国也是存在一个个等级的，但人人平等是写进宪法的，为什么呢？因为只有存在一个目标，才有前进的方向，才不会迷路。）<br><br>　　4、是（这点没有任何商量的余地，不同意的没有资格当版主）</div><br><div> </div><br><div>2005年11月22日</div></div>

            <div id="msgcns!5156F7D537FE522!140" class="bvMsg"><div><br><br>　　听说有人打赌房价不跌，中国迟早会出乱子，而且是大乱子。这真是奇闻，我就从没有听说过一个政府会把让每个人买得起房子作为一个目标或任务，让每个人有得吃有得住反而更现实一点。同理，如果有人期望政府让所有人都买得起房子，也是不现实的，甚至有点无理。<br><br>　　大城市的物价高，有钱人相对也集中一点，房价高不足为奇，没必要大惊小怪。现在中国已经不是计划经济了吧？无论一个市场如何不规范，价格或多或少总能反映供求关系。如果没有需求，房地产商能够长期托住高昂的价格吗？短期内可以，但长期是绝对撑不住的。所以无论上海等地的房价高到什么程度，如果它长期跌不下来，供肯定小於或等於求，也就是说在如此高的价位，依然造多少，卖多少。买家中有一部分是炒家，他们对楼市的高价格也有推波助澜的作用，可是也不能光怪他们，毕竟人家没有犯法，也要冒高风险来做买卖。为什么有炒家？还不是因为供小於求？张学友开演唱会炒票的人一大把，而我开演唱会可能有人炒票吗？就是这个道理。房地产商和炒家都不用担心需求，房价能不涨吗？归根到底，房价如此高，消费者有没有责任呢？在我看来，消费者需要负最大的责任。在房子问题上，存在着太多不理性的消费者了。理性的消费者有个特征，就是只愿意为商品付合理的价格。如果消费者都是理性的，房价不可能疯涨的。房子价格不合理，消费者不买，价格迟早会跌。可我看到的却是大家不断地嚷贵，但又一窝蜂地抢购房子，高价格就是这样被不理性的消费者帮忙推上去的。不要以为光一个人做理性的消费者没用，这些一个个加起来，就是一股巨大的市场力量。一个市场不规范，整个市场的参与者都需要负相应的责任。<br><br>　　话说回来，对於国内房价是否过高，我不敢妄下判断。把目光放在全国其它中小城市，我觉得房价还是存在着一个合理的价格序列的，消费者并不是没有选择的余地，根据自己的经济实力决定就行。老拿房价最高的地方说事，有什么意义呢？尤其是上海，上海是个很特殊的城市，估计中央也希望把上海建设成香港那样的国际大都市。如果按这条思路走下去的话，上海的房价日后向香港看齐也不是不可能的。国内大城市的房价的确不低，可哪个国家的大城市房价不高？在发达国家，例如澳洲，也不是全部人买得起房子，租房子的老外大有人在。而且有能力买房子的人也要根据自己的资本作相应的选择，有钱的可以选择去大城市，可以选择住市中心；钱较少的可以选择去中小城市，可以选择住得离市中心远一点；钱很少的可以选择买二手房，或者租房子。只要坚持市场经济，让需求调节价格，而消费者都尽量保持理性，房价能不能涨起来是由需求决定的事，而是否买房子，在哪里买房子，怎么样才能拥有房子等等，才是个人需要决定的事。<br><br>　　买不起房子在任何地方都不是一件稀奇的事，房价跟造反根本没有必然联系。想想香港人买房子的困难，看看现在内地的房价也该偷笑了。我从香港出境的时候，在叔叔单位的房子(叔叔在内地和香港两边跑，在香港时就住在那里)住了几天，那个房子一百多平方米，价值两千多万港币。太贵的不说，就算普通一点的房子也要几百万港币，而且往往只是几十平方米，香港人买房子比内地的人难多了，没有自己房子的香港人也多的是，可也没见过有人鼓吹房价不降就会乱。如果说跟造反有联系的东西，排在首位的肯定是食物的价格，说老百姓会因为房价高而造反，有点杞人忧天甚至哗众取宠了。就算现在的房价再涨10倍，只要收入最低的人能够吃饱，而且有地方住，中国就不可能乱，只不过有能力买房子的人会越来越少而已。<br><br>　　在我眼里，房价高不是根本问题，社会没有公正，财富分配不公，国民对生活没有信心才是严重的问题。我理想中的国度应该是这样的：可以有富人和穷人，但国家提供给他们致富的机会是均等的，日子过成什么样，让国民自己去奋斗。怀着这个理想，我走了，希望有一天，我可以带着这个理想回去。<br><br>　　2005年6月18日于墨尔本<br></div></div>

I had a course of Software Engineering when I was in China doing my bachelor’s degree, but I felt that was far from enough. Hoping to further my understanding in this area, I chose Software Engineering Case Study. As time goes by, many problems arise. After a few weeks’ thinking, I want to discuss something which has been in my mind.<br><br>For a student who has practical experience about software development in a company might do very good in this course, but it might not be the case for a novice. In fact, it is almost impossible for a novice–someone who has never worked as software developing team member or who only had skin-deep knowledge about Software Engineering–to get a good mark or learn very much from this course. That is my conclusion, and I am eager to know if my conclusion will prove to be true at the end of the semester. I will discuss a few things below.<br><br><strong>Citation </strong><br><br>I enjoy reading very much, especially reading books of philosophy. I also like writing very much, but I pay little attention to citation, maybe just because I have been influencing by top philosophers so much. It is so difficult to imagine Nietzsche citing someone else’s words, I think, except when he was mocking at someone. Besides, I always kept Russell’s word in mind, so I never turn to authority—as if mere authority were a reason to cite— because there will always be the case that one can find another authority on the opposite side. It is not until I enrolled this course did I focus on the problem of citation. After some thoughts, I realized that actually I cited very often, just I didn’t wake up to it.<br><br>Is citation useful or necessary? I’ve been thinking this question for quite a long time, and I have answer now. Personally I think citation serves two purposes. One the one hand, the direct use of citation is to share information. Through citations, the readers are able to broaden their sources of information. They may know something happened—probably— in a particular time, or they may realize someone holds a certain ttitude—maybe—toward something, or they may be introduced to some theoretical models in certain areas and so on. But we should always keep it in mind that the information we obtain is simply material, it does not by itself prove anything without analysis. On the other hand, citation has indirect use of making contribution to someone’s knowledge database. With citation, it is possible for us to build a huge web of knowledge that contains many linkages within an area or even between different areas. It provides a chance for the readers to enrich their knowledge.<br><br>Moreover, citation is not only useful but also necessary. Proper citation is one of the requirements to write a wonderful article. Let’s imagine there is a scientific article without any citation, I am sure no one can find any convincing evidence for most of the things the author is trying to state. Reading an article with lots of necessary information duly supplied is a kind of enjoyment, unfortunately most of the articles published can not provide that service. I must learn to cite correctly for its usefulness and necessity, I thought to myself, even if only hoping to be able to write something interesting.<br><br>Though I finally agreed that citation were both useful and necessary, when I knew that our research paper must contain fixed numbers of citations, I began to panic, since I am only a novice at Software Engineering, unfortunately. Now I am facing a dilemma–to produce a ‘research paper’ full of improper citations in order to meet the course requirement or to write a paper that does not meet the course requirement completely but reflect my true understanding about the topic I am researching. I prefer latter.<br><br>Haste makes waste. In academia, improper standards are producing more and more shocking phenomena of academic corruption. For example, in China , there is a growing trend that more and more researchers including some professors plagiarize others’ work. Why? Because they will lose the jobs or chances for promotion if there is no fruit of their works. To set a deadline for a research project or require certain amount of outcome in a fixed time goes against the spirit of research. All research institutes that want to come out with fruitful result only need to concentrate on the construction of excellent research environment, that’s it. John Nash, the 1994 economic Nobel Prize receiver and mathematical professor in Princeton University , for most time in his life suffered schizophrenia and homosexuality, but Princeton University treated him like a normal person and provided him the best research environment all alone, then Game Theory succeeded finally. What Princeton University did to John Nash was the reason why he succeeded and why Princeton University always has been one of the best universities in the world. Remember this example of Nash firmly please. Now let’s leave that out of this for the time being and let me begin my analysis—citation.<br><br>Basically I can think of four kinds of citations, facts, theories, viewpoints and conclusions and I will discuss them one by one.<br><br><strong>1 </strong><br><br>First I will discuss the citation of facts. This kind of citation is relatively the easiest one, in my opinion, because history is history and no man can change it. For instance, the fact that _Principles of Economics _was written by Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) and that Karl Marx (1818-1883) died in 1883 can never be modified. But it is very easy to misuse “facts” because of carelessness, credulousness, ignorance or some other reasons. For example, in economics, there were some very careless quoters, and a very famous one was great economist A. C. Pigou （ 1877-1959 ） . Here is a very interesting episode. Economist Steven Chueng said in his book that he once spent a whole week tracing the source of the materials mentioned in Pigou’s book, but couldn’t find the fact that Pigou provided in his book. That might suggest that Pigou made up some data to support his model. And, withal, according to Steven’s observation, even Marshall, one of the most influential economists of his generation even in the history, and John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), the founder of macroeconomics, also were quite careless about citation. Even if great economists in the history didn’t pay enough attentions to citations of facts, let alone normal writers. One very interesting thing is about the critic Steven Cheung himself. In his book <em>Economic explanation</em> which is written in Chinese, I found a mistake. When he mentioned Pigou, the original text was “A.C.Pigou (1873-1959)”, but from what I know, Pigou was born in 1877, not 1873. It might be publishing error, but it is a good example to convince readers not to believe the ‘facts’ they heard or even they saw without validation. Here I am going to describe another problem about citation of facts. In economic papers, many writers would use some examples stated in another writers’ book or article. Though the example is cited exactly the same as it first appeared, the problem is that the example was stated by the author as a hypothetical case but became the fact in the quoter’ s article. Maybe writer A wrote “Let’s suppose that there is a factory keeps draining waste water through neighbor’s garden…”, but writer B cited “A provided a very interesting example in his study of externality, there is a factory…” Notice, the fancy became truth unconsciously. To cite a fact correctly needs a lot of time to validate, and that is the main constraint that prevents writers from making proper citations of this kind.<br><br>Finally let’s go back to the case of John Nash above that I asked for attention in order to take a closer look at the complexity about citation of fact, or citation. Read that example again and ask yourself what information was provided? You may write down (1) John Nash received Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994; (2) He suffered from schizophrenia and had a tendency of homosexuality; (3) Princeton University did not abandon him but provided him the best research environment instead; (4) Game Theory succeeded in the economic field; (5) What Princeton University did was the reason why John Nash succeeded and why Princeton University always has been one of the best universities in the world. (1), (2), (3) and (4) can be classified as facts and (5) are both conclusion and viewpoint. We only analyze facts here. Among them, (1), (2) and (4) are easy to validate, but (3) is tricky. In this case, we may choose to believe or to be doubtful, I choose later. I found something on the web, “ … _the staffs at my university, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and later all of Boston were behaving strangely towards me…. I started to see crypto-communists everywhere … I started to think I was a man of great religious importance, and to hear voices all the time. I began to hear something like telephone calls in my head, from people opposed to my ideas. …The delirium was like a dream from which I seemed never to awake.” _Maybe fact (3) was true in some sense, but not necessarily the same as most people think. In a word, facts are not as obvious as they appear. The more time we have, the better citation of this kind is able to be used.<br><br><strong>2 </strong><br><br>Secondly, I would talk about the citation of theories. Usually theories will be misquoted, but seldom fudged. It is quite different from citation of facts, because unlike facts, it is almost impossible to make up theories. So from quotations of this kind, we could identify novices whose understanding about the theory is half-baked, but we are less likely to find a cheater who insist there are a theory not known to the world except him. So whether a theory is cited properly mainly base on the quoter’s familiarity about it.<br><br><strong>3 </strong><br><br>The third kind of citation is that of viewpoints. This kind is the most difficult one because of the fact that an author’s idea is often misunderstood. When we are reading or hearing something, in fact we are trying to experience the whole process of thought-flow in the author or speaker’s mind. Let’s put that process of recurring on a scale from 0 to100 points. Let’s imagine a group of people of different levels gather together to study an article or to listen to a speech. How many of them will completely understand (100 points) what they saw or heard? And how many of them totally misunderstood (zero point) what they saw or heard? I am not sure if there is anyone who only gets 0 point, but I am sure that nobody gets 100 points. In a stricter sense, nobody fully understands what the others are trying to express. However, we should try to deepen our comprehension about the world and make ourselves more informed members in the universe so that we are able to get the exact meaning of others and make ourselves careful quoters of viewpoints. To study philosophy will help very much in that endeavor, if I am permitted to give a suggestion here.<br><br>Suppose I am expressing my opinion, here is an example,” I don’t support autarchy, but under some circumstances, democracy has a higher cost than that of dictatorship, so autarchy might be favorable in that case, especially when the dictator has the personality of Socrates (469-399BC.)” What’s my viewpoint? Am I a supporter of autarchy or democracy? Different people have different understanding and judgment. Some may conclude that I am a backer of tyranny and the others think I am actually a democracy-liker. If I were an authority, my words might be used as citation, but where my word would be used remains an enigma. It is not totally impossible that it appears in both of two person’s articles as their supporting argument while they are on complete opposite position. In the real world, things are much more complex than this simple case and that makes the task of citing others’ viewpoints as difficult as understanding them.<br><br>In addition, the sentences being cut out from the context would cut both ways. Let’s use the same example above and break it into some smaller sentences and take out two of them for analysis. (1) I don’t support autarchy and (2) autarchy might be favorable. Is it possible that another two persons take one sentence each and quote? Of course it is. I am sure that my original intension will be lost forever if my original words are missing.<br><br>Since understanding others’ opinions is such a difficult job that my suggestion is always try to improve comprehension about the world and be a deep thinker, and cite others’ viewpoint when you truly get what they are saying. Otherwise, don’t quote.<br><br><strong>4 </strong><br><br>The last one is the citation of conclusions. This kind of citation is relatively harder comparing with the citation of theories. A Conclusion holds when the requirements are met. But it might not still be the case if some conditions are changed. For instance, consider the conclusion that objects drop at the same speed in the air, other things being equal. To cite the conclusion above and then conclude that a feather and an iron ball would drop to the ground at the same speed– other things being equal– is mistaken, because the conclusion stands only when the air friction is neglected. There are always some theories, truths and methodologies underlying a conclusion, they are combined with the conclusion, rather than separated. So a conclusion can never be properly cited without the profound understanding about the underlying elements mentioned above. For instance, let’s go back to the case of John Nash again. This time we will look at information (5) – What Princeton University did to him was the reason why John Nash succeeded and why Princeton University always has been one of the best universities in the world. – described above. It is a conclusion—or viewpoint in some sense. Usually we accept a conclusion only when we accept its reasoning first. The first part of that sentence is problematic from my viewpoint because although it stands from the facts given, it does not agree with the truth. Let me add some facts here into the case of John Nash. (6) In 1949, while studying for his doctorate, he wrote a paper which 45 years later was to win a Nobel Prize for economics and (7) Nash’s mental state became disturbed near the end of 1958. What does that tell us? It tells us that Nash’s research outcome— Non-cooperate games— that made him known to the world had nothing to do with Princeton ‘s attitude toward him about schizophrenia, because it was not until 1958 did his mental state become unstable. So the original conclusion collapsed when more information was mined. It might be true that the Princeton University always tries to provide the best research environment to the researchers and that might be the reason why it has been one of the best universities in the world, but the first part of the information (5) has been proved to be fault. So when we are trying to prove that Princeton University rewarded by providing excellent environment to the researchers, the example of John Nash is not a proper case to cite.<br><br>In fact there might be more categories than my simple classification of citations, and statements might fall into more than one category, so the complexity of citation might be much harder than my simple analysis above. When it comes down to it, citations are just information. They might contain true information and fault information. So first we need to identify the authenticity of information, and then consider the question of how to make use of it.<br><br>Though I am reluctant to be an irresponsible quoter, I will choose to quote the authorities in whatever field if I must believe—or only for the sake of citing – some of them. Why? The reason lies in the effect of name brand. Why do so many companies prefer candidates with higher education while inviting applications for a job? The answer is because of asymmetric information– the candidates know more about their ability than the companies do. For the companies, the cost of evaluating all the candidates’ ability is very high. In this case, other things being equal, companies are more willing to employ those with higher educational degree or graduated from a more famous school. Because by doing that, the companies can filter out less smart and unfit candidates with relatively low cost. It might happen that the outstanding and competent candidates are not selected by the discrimination caused by asymmetric information, but this possibility will not change the companies’ behavior, since they know by imposing discrimination the probability of selecting a better candidate is higher than otherwise would be. Being a novice, and facing the fact that I must cite certain amount of references while I do not have rich knowledge in this field, the best ways I could think of is to spend most of my time to gather information about authorities in the domain of my research topic, and cite their words as much as I can instead of studying the theory seriously and judging their viewpoints, conclusions or whatever using critical thinking. As a matter of fact, critical thinking is just nonsense under this circumstance, which I will discuss later. I can not emphasize enough how useful philosophy is, please firmly keep that in mind if you believe I am giving out pearls here. Since I am not doing lingual analysis, this part stops here.<br><br><strong>Framework matters </strong><br><br><em>   appreciate the complexity and ambiguity in technical, managerial, social and legal issues in software engineering;<li>be able to identify key risk factors in &quot;real world&quot; software projects, and make defensible, informed decisions for mitigating those risks; and</li><li>be able to plan for complex software engineering projects<br><br>The first time I looked at the above goals that this course is trying to achieve, I felt so excited as if I had seen my brilliant future. As time passes by, I am very depressed. Actually I never think about if I am able to be a researcher or consultant in this field after this course, because I know it is impossible. The only thing I wonder is whether I can be a qualified software engineering participant. Again I want to emphasize that I am analyzing as a novice according to my definition which was given in the first place.<br><br>I want to start my analysis from economics with which I am relatively more familiar. First let’s suppose a sophomore attending an economics seminar with presentation of top economists in the world. He might hear many words that he thinks he has known very well, say, demand and supply, production possibilities frontier, marginal analysis, cost, comparative advantage, exchange rate, tradeoff, tariff, market and so on. But is the seminar valuable for him in terms of enriching his economic knowledge or improving his research skill? I am reluctant to conclude that it is impossible, but I am afraid that it is very likely to be the truth.<br><br>For an expert, it is very easy to identify whether a person is a novice or an expert. In order to do so, basically five minutes’ chatting is enough. I ever read an article translated into English would be <em>understanding modern economics</em> written by American economist Yingyi Qian. I was enlightened at once after finished reading it. In essence, it is all about framework. The framework of modern economics consists of three parts: Perspective, Reference and Analysis tool. One standard of identifying if someone has received systematic modern economic training is to test if there is an economic framework in his mind. I ever went to a BBS on a website about economics and saw something really interesting that a couple of people argued if the Demand Curve must slope downward. A famous Chinese economist named Dingding Wang wrote some articles announcing that the Demand Curve not necessarily slope downward, but could not convince any weighty economist. It is true that a curve can either slope upward or slope downward, but whenever talking about the Demand Curve in economics, it is a truth that it must slope downward, that’s determined by the framework of economics. It is very clear that Dingding Wang is first a philosopher, then an economist, because he does not have a modern economics framework in his mind. I agree that an economist who at the same time is not a philosopher is unlikely end up to be a significant one, and maybe there are more requirements demanded. In my opinion, Dingding Wang does much better in philosophy than in economics. He might have the ambition to unify economics, which in some sense is something similar to what Albert Einstein(1879-1955) tried to do in his old age in the field of Physics, but I do not think he can make it according his understanding about economics. Maybe he wanted to redraw the boundary for economics, but I am very doubtful if he knew the current boundary clearly. Almost all prominent economists make mistakes, let alone those without systematic and strict economic training. Don’t be surprised when you meet someone who tells you that the Demand Curve in economics can slope upward, for the world abound with untrained but highly vocal amateurs in every domain. Those who have received systematically training in certain field have the same framework. They know where the subject starts and where it ends, they know what a term means, they understand the merits and flaws of a model, they look into problems from same perspective, they analyze events on the same benchmark, and they know when to use an analysis tool is right and when is not…I am very interested to know what will happen to that lucky—or unlucky—sophomore during the seminar. I think many economists would be very interested in him at first and want to talk to him, for they consider him to be a talented and promising young genius in economics.<br><br>“Do you think it possible to eliminate the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment?” The first economist asked him.<br><br>“I don’t know.”<br><br>“Do you know there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run?”<br><br>“Yes, I do.”<br><br>“OK.” The first economist left.<br><br>The second economist talked to him, “Do you think the tax police being implemented now would cause greater deadweight loss than last year?”<br><br>“I have no idea.”<br><br>“Do you know what deadweight loss is?”<br><br>“Yes, I do.”<br><br>“I see.” The second economist left too.<br><br>The third economist came up to him and said, “I really can not agree with Friedman’s methodology, it is totally unreasonable.”<br><br>“Er…”<br><br>“Do you know Friedman’s methodology?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“All right.” The third economists also left.<br><br>There are so many things he doesn’t know, and even if he knows them, he is too inexperienced to use them yet. No more economists come to the poor boy, because they saw what happened to him, and they judge from what they saw that the boy is not likely to be a genius since he attracted none of the economists talked to him and they decide to make good use of their time by exchanging research outcome with real economists. Don’t mind them, because, you know, they are economists. The poor sophomore feels very sad knowing that his cost of attending this seminar is much higher than he expected since what he can understand is so little. If I were him, probably I would make myself a “parrot”. Economist Gregory Mankiw said that even a parrot can be an economist simply by learning to say “demand and supply”. If I don’t understand what is going on very well, memorizing the most famous economists’ newest research outcome might be the best solution. That’s kind of the same feeling I have during the course.<br><br>The biggest problem for a novice is that he does not have a complete framework in his mind, just like that poor sophomore. Without the framework in mind, you cannot even point out the mistakes or ask meaningful questions. That’s the reason why I have become a very dumb student in class. Someone even cannot use the tool of critical thinking when the framework has not been stably established. Suppose a case of teaching pupils that one plus one equals two. What if someone breaks into the class and claims that one plus one equals two has not yet been proved completely in pure mathematics? He might be a critical thinker, but he can’t be an expert in education, because he doesn’t have a framework of education in his mind. In this case, that “critical thinker” should be kept outside the field of education no matter how good he can use the tool of critical thinking. Critical thinking is simply a tool, not the content. I remembered the first time I heard the word cost in class, the first thing appeared in my mind was what cost meant here. In economics, the cost of something is what you give up to get it. Whenever economists mention cost, they are always referring to opportunity cost, namely the cost defined above. Will you do a business when economists publish a report that says the profit of that business is zero? I will. Since unlike accounts only keep track of money, economists take into account the other elements other than money. So a business yields zero profit in an economist’s eye would actually be profitable in the account book. There are many terms, tools, skills, rules and so on in the field of Software Engineering, to set up a framework is to understand the terminology, to learn to use the tools, to master the skills, to know the rules and so on. I would devote more than 90% of the time and effort in building a student’s framework if I were the teacher. I won’t think too much about how well I can run when I can not even walk freely. Foundation is so important that the top researchers will only emerge from those with solid framework. As I mentioned before that an expert could identify another expert from a group of people easily. For a person who can talk more than two hours about Software Engineering but without a clear framework or practical experience in his mind, he is sure to be excluded by the experts. By the time I am able to be a qualified researcher, I must have set up the framework of Software Engineering completely. The chance of becoming a good researcher exists though slim, but it has not arrived yet. I am not looking forward to be a researcher or consultant, what I wish is that the framework of Software Engineering will arrive in search of me as soon as possible, in other word, I not to be a novice anymore. So I cry out loudly in my mind all the time, “framework, framework, framework…” and I reject those try to teach me how to run with gentle words, “I really appreciate your kindness, but I want to learn to walk first, thank you so much.” Even if famous Italian generalist like Vinci (1452-1519) spent so many years learning how to draw eggs, maybe we should ponder this case thoroughly. Similarly, to produce qualified researcher is unable to achieve simply by assuming they had solid foundations and concentrating on teaching them abstract methodologies. Basic knowledge (framework) is body, and methodology is soul. A body without soul can’t walk far, but soul without a body is nothing.<br><br>I am sure there are some people who already have profound understanding about Software Engineering consider it tough to imagine the difficulties that a novice faces while doing a so-called research project. To illustrate, just use my personal experience as an example. I am doing a research with three other students and we met in this afternoon. Basically they want to prove that there are biases between software developer and end user and then invent some tools or something to reduce that bias. I find myself asking various questions. Isn’t that obvious and normal that bias always exist between developer and user? (It is always!)Does it matter that there are biases? (I don’t think so) How is it possible to prove it in such a short time when we are not able to generate a lot of data? (Make up some? J ) How do we design a good questionnaire that can prove our conclusion? (Personal I think it is very unlikely) Even if we collect the data, is it possible that it doesn’t support the conclusion? (Very likely) Why do we have to make user understand UML diagram? (Not necessary) Should we focus on the translation between technological language and language that the user can understand instead of how to make them understand something like UML? (I think so) Should we focus on proving biases exist instead of how to eliminate that bias? (I think we should not) Is there any point to prove such a conclusion? (I think it’s quite silly) …I am very confused. Although so, I dare not to say the conceivable research topic is ridiculous. Because the question I asked here might be as silly as the stupid question of “can Demand Curve slope upward?” in economics. Whenever I think of that, I am afraid that the problem might lie in me. If I successfully did something that the so-called researchers never believed, so I will just insist on my viewpoints and keep moving forward. The problem is I have not a clear framework, so maybe I should try to identify what kind of questions are not to be asked first. Look, critical thinking is not helpful but only contributes to my confusion in this case. This is relative to another conclusion of mine about teacher selection for this course which I will discuss in the next part. If some still cannot imagine my puzzle Dom, please forget about the sophomore, just attend an economics seminar yourself, collect all the papers and work on a “researcher project”. Two days later, you’ll get what I was saying. In next part, let’s discuss something about education.<br><br><strong>Dreamer or doer? </strong><br><br>Software Engineering is a very practical subject and needs a great deal of practice. To learn something has three conditions: attitude, technique and environment. For those teachers who want to teach well must focus on these three conditions. They should inject confidence into students and help them overcome difficulties stand on their way, they should teach students how to do things right and avoid making stupid mistakes, and they should also provide the best learning environment for the students to make them fully understand what they are learning. For this course, only teaching theory is a great obstacle that prevents students from getting the most from it. When I was taking the same course in China , the teacher made students develop software synchronously so as to apply the theory. I find that so useful, because we were not just talking about theory but actually practicing it. Many people may have this experience that not until they really touched and felt something did they know what it was. There were some people who could recite lots of books of tactics very well in ancient china, though they never went through a war. But when they were sent to the battlefield as a commander, almost all of them lost the war. After all theory and practice are different things. For those want to make a living in a research institute, all they need to do is to develop theories and forget about practices completely, but it would be a tragedy for those need to make a living outside the ivory tower to imitate. I am being taught how to build something in our mind, and it may be the most beautiful thing in my head so that I feel so proud and fall into inebriation whenever I close my eye. But when someone asks me, “Can I see it?” My answer must be, “Sorry, I’ve never seen it with my own eyes myself.” All valuable researches should base on practices, and they can not survive alone.<br><br>I’ve heard that in Australia a person who has a certificate from TAFE is much easier to find a job than a postgraduate. After taking this course, I see why. I would do so if I were a boss. Other than the financial factor another possible reason is that a postgraduate might be too theoretical to do something practical. It might happen that the postgraduate reply the boss with something like “I don’t know how to do this for I only research, but if you want to know about some theory, I am your man.” When he is saying that, In contrast, the TAFE graduate is already working on it. Only a fool would hire a consultant who does not have practical software engineering experience, if there is one, I am sure his company would close down soon.<br><br>In my life, there were a few times that I was attracted by some really good people with rich knowledge and after listened to their speeches I just had a feeling that they blew my mind. Maybe that’s the use of good mentor—to learn the maximum knowledge within the shortest time. “Principles of microeconomics was the most eye-opening course I have ever taken. All subsequent courses in economics have exhibited the property of diminishing returns.” said Gregory Mankiw. I have similar felling when I am doing my master’s degree, because the most eye-opening courses in my life have been taken some years ago. To produce a qualified but not so-called researcher is a very difficult job and needs many strict requirements. On the student side, it is required that they have solid foundations, right way of thinking and doing things, good understanding about the framework, rich knowledge, stamina and scientific spirit and so on. On the teacher side, passion for teaching, the ability of discovering the student’s defeat in the framework, the ability of expressing themselves, the ability of arousing student’s interest, understanding student’s psychology, and abundance in both theory and experience and so on are needed. In a word, to be good learner and good teacher needs their own efforts and cooperation.<br><br>We have two teachers in this course. I don’t know why there are two but that’s the truth. One is enough, I strongly suggest. Teacher A always emphases “critical thinking” and that’s his tag. But the problem is that no material things were transferred into my mind except for the repetition of “critical thinking”. For someone who has never used critical thinking may benefit from a new concept being put into his or her mind. As for me, the information that is valuable received is very little. There are a few times I ended up regretting for the time lost after class and forced myself to think about “sunk cost” then forgot it and continued to do other things. Another thing is that I have a very strong felling that he is not a practical expert because basically all he said was methodologies and very abstract things. The class is becoming an English language class or whatever but Software Engineering. Teacher A may have rich experience of critical thinking and teaching, but that’s not a good reason that he should teach such a practical course. Teacher A is more suitable to be the supervisor of master of research or a doctor, not coursework students.<br><br>Teacher B is pretty good. I can see that he has ample experience and he usually goes to the heart of problems that include theoretical, technological and practical ones. Unfortunately his time is too little. In fact, 80% to 90% of the time should be allocated to him. And the rest of the time could be given to Teacher A if he must be involved in this course. Because the goal of this course should focus on the framework, not research skill. I am not saying that research skill is not important, but the truth is framework is the base and research skill is the extension, not reverse. It is attending to trifles and neglecting the essentials if that relationship is overturned.<br><br>A teacher has great influences on his students, especially when the teacher is a mentor. How important is a mentor? “…For reasons that are a mystery to me now, Harvey hired me as a research assistant for the summer after my freshman year. I knew very little economics, for I had taken only the two principles courses.… For whatever reason, Harvey did hire me, and the experience proved invaluable. I knew so little that Harvey had to teach me whatever he needed me to know. Spending a summer being tutored by a top teacher and scholar is the best learning experience I can imagine. To this day, I have never learned so much in so short a period of time.” Economist Mankiw Said so in his article “<em>my rules of thumb</em>”. I couldn’t help thinking of my experience. Just this morning, I went to the computer lab for the tutorial of parallel programming and computation. Since I don’t have any programming experience under UNIX, I just asked a guy in the same class who can use UNIX so well to teach me how to setup the PVM running environment and how to compile c file, and he said, “Sorry, I think you have to figure it out by yourself.” Then continue his chat with friends. Almost nobody was willing to spend a little time to offer me some help. Then I met this really good guy name Mevan. He showed me the things I need to know but I don’t and even explained source codes to me patiently. He spent around five minutes to help me, and it saved me probably a few hours that might be wasted in order to get started. Mevan is like a mentor since he has the personality of a mentor. I can imagine from my wonderful five-minute-experience under direction of Mevan that how much Mankiw learned in that summer. I envy him.<br><br>The difference between a mentor and a common teacher lies in that a common teacher assumes students know something and teach according to his schedule of teaching and a mentor test what students know and teach according to their schedule of learning. Since I am not familiar with UNIX, I had many troubles when doing the project. I went to the teacher and ask for help, but teacher just told me that he assumed that I knew UNIX and I needed to find some book about UNIX then worked on it. What a vague instruction? I am not hoping that he teach me UNIX all over again, but if I were a teacher, I would tell the student specifically all the things he need to master when doing this project and give him a book list then tell him which chapter to read. A mentor can really teach student a lot and save lots of their time. So I strongly appeal all the teachers not to assume students know something but really find out what they are missing in order to help them on the track and care for them from time to time, and they will move alone the right track healthily. These are absolutely not tiny little things. By doing that, a teacher will discover that his students are all qualified researchers one day. One thing worth to be pointed out is that good teachers can reduce the students’ cost while studying. How much cost students might pay when they did not receive timely point out of mistakes? Supposed a hypothetical example of a teacher assumes his students know conservation of energy and asks them to design something. After some time, the students hand in a blueprint entitled “Perpetual Motion Machine”. Isn’t that a sad story? I am not an educational expert, so I had better end this part now.<br><br><strong>Content and Format </strong><br><br>I ever asked the teacher a question in class, “What if an article is wonderfully written but the content is so ridiculous from your viewpoint?” Basically his answer was that it didn’t matter too much. But is that true? I am very doubtful. It’s so perfect that there is an article with brilliant format and wonderful content, but that seldom happens. There are lots of articles with barren content and bad format, some articles with good format but empty content, and few articles with fad format but excellent content. Outside the field of literature, content is the most important element that determines its value in its area. Even in the field of literature, content is more important than format is some sense. So can a novice write a valuable article in his area? It is almost impossible. He may write an article with a wonderful format, but the constraints he faces have determined the outcome.<br><br>Economics and philosophy are wonderful subjects to learn and they can be used to analyze so many things and predict the result. “People face tradeoff” is one of the economic rules summarized by Gregory Mankiw in his popular economics textbook <em>Principles of Economics</em>. That is a very good rule for analysis of many things. If I spend more time in reading books, I will have less time to watch TV or do other things. If I spend more money on entertainment, I will have less money to spend on food or other things. Everyone faces constraints such as money, energy, time and so on. For this course, the main constraints are knowledge and time. It is a very short course that last only a little bit longer than 10 weeks, that constraint determines the room for improvement is very small, unless we have a really good mentor here. Furthermore, if a student has a firm framework basically has already determined his mark to be good or bad. For a novice, under these constraints, a tradeoff arises– Content or format. It would be good that a novice can provide a paper not only full of excellent viewpoints but also in a good format. But facing the constraints I am afraid that is very unlikely to happen. A research paper not so well written but full of excellent ideas and good content is much better than that is excellent written but with nothing valuable. Knowledge never been digested can not be used properly, and digest needs time and comprehension. So no matter a novice focuses on the content or the format of a paper, he can’t come out with valuable result, for the ending is already determined at the start. Personal endeavor might change the bad result a little bit, but cannot be very much.<br><br>Back to the research project we are doing here. Though everyone faces constraints, every student faces different constraints. Some students know more about Software Engineering than others, some students have more working experience than others, and some students have better partners than others and so on. There are still elements outside the course itself. Some students have more courses than others so they have less time to work on the project. Once enough information of the students is obtained, the outcome of the research project is known already. For a novice, facing the fact that he has fuzzy framework about the course, he must cite a certain amount of words, he has surface understanding about Software Engineering, he has little or even no working experience, and he can’t be beneficial very much from the teacher according to my analysis above and so on, it is almost impossible for him to write a decent research paper. And if he happens to have less time to work on the research project, it is very possible that he might fail in this course finally.<br><br><strong>Prediction </strong><br><br>According to my analysis above, I make a few predictions below.<br><br>1. At the end of semester, novice will have lower mark than experienced students.<br><br>2. At the end of semester, the best research paper will come from experienced students, and the excellent citation only appears in experienced students’ paper.<br><br>3. At the end of semester, averagely those only choose three subjects in this semester would have a better grade than those choose four, for they have more time and better energy to work on the research project.<br><br>4. At the end of semester, no novice will be qualified to be a researcher or consultant.<br><br>I must stop here for my own constraints. I need to finish my programming using PVM before next Friday and I still have not started yet. Furthermore, I need to read many paper about requirements and something about XML. Above is some brief analysis about some problems that a novice like me might have when doing this course, though the result is rather depressed according to my judgment, I will do my best. This is not a research paper, just some personal views, or maybe prose would be a better word to describe it. I hope my predictions to be wrong, so I might need to improve my analytic approach and ability. I spent some extra hours working on this, it might not be right and objective, however, all I hope is this course will be improved gradually.<br><br>One last thing, which is the most beneficial course for me so far? LaTeX! Good stuff, just something new and appealing to me. I have never used it, unfortunately, maybe next time.<br><br><strong>(The End) </strong><br><br><em>*Eric Rong</em></li></em> (rongweinan@hotmail.com) is a student in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Melbourne, Australia.<br><br>September 7, 2003<br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
